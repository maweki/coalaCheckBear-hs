# example Coala Bear

This bear checks whether you've used the correct cases when referring to coala in your source file.

To test it with an example file , run `stack build && cat in.example.json | stack exec coalaCheckBear-hs`. Once the coala-side is done, coala would invoke this automatically once the bear is registered.

You can find the bindings at https://github.com/maweki/coalaHs
